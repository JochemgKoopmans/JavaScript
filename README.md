# JavaScript
Scripts written in JavaSript (optionally with HTML, CSS)
- Most of these projects are behavioural experiments programmed using the JsPsych javascript framework (https://www.jspsych.org/). JsPsych is a framework that preprograms many recurring elements for online behavioural psychology experiments and presents an experiment style using css. I added these JsPsych and other files for completeness; with these files you can run the experiment scripts to see they are about.
- The folders corresponding to the Cognitive Neuroscience Master's thesis project are subsequent versions of an experiment idea in development. As such, they will look similar. Still, each iteration presents new experiment logic and/or functionalities, which is why I show them here as separate projects.
