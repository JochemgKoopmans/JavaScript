# JavaScript
Scripts written in JavaSript (optionally with HTML, CSS)
- Most of these projects are behavioural experiments programmed using the JsPsych javascript framework (https://www.jspsych.org/). JsPsych is a framework that preprograms many recurring elements for online behavioural psychology experiments and presents an experiment style using css. I added these JsPsych and other files for completeness; with these files you can run the experiment scripts to see they are about.
